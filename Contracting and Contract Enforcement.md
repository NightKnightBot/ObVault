Any contract includes 3 essential elements
1. *An **Offer** is commitment with certain terms made to another party.*
2. *An **Acceptance** is a willingness to take the offer.*
3. *â€‹**Consideration** is the agreed upon exchange of something valuable.*

**An implied contract can be formed between 2 or more parties that act as if a contract exists, even if no contract have been written or signed**

Contracts are a key element of all business practices.
Offers and acceptances can occur when parties exchange:
- E-Mail Messages
- Engage in Electronic Data Interchange
- Fill out forms on Web-pages

For Example:
1. A website **invites offers** for a product at a specified price as **consideration**.
2. The customer **offers** to buy the product.
3. The website **accepts** the offer.
