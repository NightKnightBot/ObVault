[[Email Marketing]]

- Sending an email to a customer can cost less than one rupee when the email address is known
- Purchasing the email addresses of people can add a cost increase of a few rupees to a hundred rupees
- The practice of sending e-mail messages to people who request information on a  particular topic or about a specific product is called ***opt-in e-mail***
- A marketing strategy that sends **specific information** only to people who have indicated an **interest in receiving information** about the product or service being promoted should be **more successful** than a marketing strategy that sends general promotional messages through the mass media.
