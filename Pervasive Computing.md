- Pervasive Computing is the new trend of **embedding everyday objects with microprocessors so that they can communicate information**
- It is also known as Ubiquitous Computing
- It is a combination of three technologies, namely:
	1. ***Microelectronic Technology***
		- This gives small and powerful devices and displays with low energy consumptions
	2. ***Digital Communication Technology***
		- This gives higher bandwidth and data transfer rate at lower costs with world wide roaming
	3. ***The Internet Standardization***
		- This is done through various standardization bodies and industries to give the framework for combining all components into an interoperable system with security, service and billing systems
