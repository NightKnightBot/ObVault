In an auction, a seller offers an item up for sale, but does not establish a price.

Potential buyers are given information about the item or some opportunity to examine the item; they can then offer bids.

# English Auction
- Bidders publicly announce their successive higher bids until no higher bid is forthcoming in the English auction
- The auctioneer pronounces the item sold to the highest bidder at that bidder’s price
- An English auction is an open auction because the bids are publicly announced
- An English auction has a minimum bid or reserve price

# Yankee Auction
- English auctions that offer multiple units of an item for sale and that allow bidders to specify the quantity they want to buy are called Yankee auctions
- Under bidders choose the balance at their top price

# Dutch Auction
- The Dutch auction is a form of open auction in which bidding starts at a high price and drops until a bidder accepts the price
- Dutch auctions are also called descending-price auctions
- Successful bidder selects the quantity required and auction resumes
- Dutch auctions are particularly good for moving large numbers of commodity items quickly

# First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction
- Bidders submit their sealed bids independently to auctioneer and are usually prohibited from sharing information with each other.
- In a first-price sealed-bid auction, auctioneer opens sealed bids at close of bidding and highest (or lowest) bidder wins

# Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auctions
- The second-price sealed-bid auction is the same as the first-price sealed-bid auction except that the highest bidder is awarded the item at the price bid by the second-highest bidder
- Second-price sealed-bid auctions are commonly called Vickrey auctions

# Double Auctions
- In a double auction, buyers and sellers each submit combined price-quantity bids to an auctioneer
- The auctioneer matches the sellers’ offers to the buyers’ offers until all the quantities offered for sale are sold to buyers
- Double auctions can be operated in either sealed-bid or open-outcry formats
