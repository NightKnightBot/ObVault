## *What is E-Cash*
E-Cash was a digital-based system that facilitated the transfer of funds anonymously. 
A pioneer in cryptocurrency, its goal was to secure the privacy of individuals that use the Internet for micropayments.
Till now, no software-based payment method can fulfil1 the transferability requirement. 
People can duplicate data in a computer easily, so it is almost impossible to prevent double spending unless a third party is involved to verify the transaction during the payment process.
