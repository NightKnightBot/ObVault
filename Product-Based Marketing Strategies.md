[[Chapter 4 - E Commerce strategies]]

- Companies offer a variety of products to appeal to different groups of people
- Both the nature of their products and the nature of their potential customers must be considered when creating a marketing strategy
- Many companies think of their businesses in terms of the products and services they sell.
- If managers are asked to describe their company's product then they will give you a detailed list of their products or services
- This makes sense when customers are likely to buy products by looking at the categories
- They arrange their websites in a similar way to the way they arranged their product design and manufacturing process
- This works well if the customer arrives to find a specific product but not so if they arrive to fulfill a specific need
